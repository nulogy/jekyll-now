## Motivation

Over the course of development on a project, there are many common jobs that one may run on a daily basis, such as:

* Starting a Rails app and watching a log tail
* Running a Zeus server and monitoring its status
* Monitoring RSpec output
* Keeping an IRB session open for quick experiments

I like to have a consistent workspace and layout that I can assume is readily available, as opposed to hunting down multiple terminal windows on my desktop. **iTerm2** happens to provide a built-in mechanism for preserving workspaces and layouts.

## Solution

Once you have all of your iTerm2 panes, windows, and tabs arranged to your liking, you can hit **⌘⇧s** (*Command-Shift-S*) to **S**ave and name your arrangement.

The next time you start iTerm2, you can **R**estore your saved layout by pressing **⌘⇧r** (*Command-Shift-R*).
