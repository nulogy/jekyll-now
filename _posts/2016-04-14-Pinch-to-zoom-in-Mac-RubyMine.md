PROBLEM
-----
I am presenting some source code during a meeting on RubyMine on my Mac machine. When I plug into the projector, my display resolution becomes quite high, so all text on the projector become very small. Using "CMD +" does not zoom in.

SOLUTION
-----
Instead, you will need to pinch the Mac's touchpad with two fingers to control the zoom. Pinch inwards for zoom-out and outwards for zoom-in. You will need to do this on every code tab you have open.

**Thanks for the tip, Sean Kirby.**
