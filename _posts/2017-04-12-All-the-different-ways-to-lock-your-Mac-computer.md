* Using the keyboard: `CTRL-SHIFT-eject`
* Using Alfred: execute the `lock` command
* Using a taskbar icon from Keychain:
  * Open the app *Keychain Access*
  * Preferences --> Enable the option "Show keychain status in menu bar"
  * A lock-shaped icon will appear in the taskbar, with the option "Lock Screen"
* Use Hot Corners:
  * *System Preferences* --> Desktop & Screen Saver --> Hot Corners button
  * Set one of the corners as "Put Display to Sleep"
  * Mouse into the direction of that corner (on the monitor closest to that side, for multi-monitor setups)
* If all else fails, just hold the Power button on your keyboard for a second to put your computer to sleep
