Problem
====

I use the slack app on my Mac, but it keeps replacing double dashes with an emdash.

e.g. --stat becomes â€”stat

Solution
===

In the slack app (and many other apps I presume?), right-click the field that has the problem, and turn off this option:

    Substitutions -> Smart Dashes
