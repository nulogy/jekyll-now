If you have the Inspect Tools open on your Google Chrome browser, you can toggle a Console tab to appear at the bottom of the Inspect pane by pressing Escape on your keyboard. This is very useful if you need to have another Inspect tab open at the same time as the Console, such as Source or React Dev Tools.
