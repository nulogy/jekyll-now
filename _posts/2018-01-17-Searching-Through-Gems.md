Sometimes you need to peak at the source of a class or method of a gem from your `Gemfile`. Since gems are managed by [`bundler`](http://bundler.io/), it has a command-line option that can help.

`bundle show --paths` will list the paths of all the gems from your `Gemfile`. You can grep through these directories to search.

I'm currently using [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching at the command line, so can pass the paths there.

Hereâ€™s it all together in a simple Bash function:

```bash
function bundle-search() {
	rg $1 `bundle show --paths`
}
```
