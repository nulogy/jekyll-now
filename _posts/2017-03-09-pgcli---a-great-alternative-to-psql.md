Ever wished for a feature-rich, intuitive command-line postgresql client? Look no further! Presenting, **[pgcli](http://pgcli.com/)** — a result of pouring creativity into features rather than the name of the tool.

Supports:

* **Smart autocompletion for almost anything**. Even column names in the select query are properly autocompleted from the table you are selecting from;
* Multi-line query editing support;
* SQL Syntax highlighting;
* CLI parameters compatible with psql params. No need to relearn anything;
* Vi mode, allowing to edit multi-line queries using some of the vi bindings. There are also Emacs bindings too;
* Installation as easy as `pip install pgcli` (and if that fails, fix is as easy as `xcode-select --install` (usually));
