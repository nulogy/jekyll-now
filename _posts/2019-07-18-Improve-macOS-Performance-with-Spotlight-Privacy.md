File contents indexing on macOS is performed by Spotlight. You can reduce Spotlight's activity by excluding directories such as:

* ~/src
* ~/Library/Caches/
* ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/
* ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.helper/

Go to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy and get yourself a faster machine.
