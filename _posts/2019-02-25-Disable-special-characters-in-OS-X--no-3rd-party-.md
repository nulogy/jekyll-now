RubyMine comes with handful of mnemonics which are supposed to boost your productivity. However ones that are combined with `alt` keys can sometimes cause unexpected behaviours since some of them are bound to special characters (e.g. ™, Ó, µ ...). 

You can disable special characters by choosing "Unicode Hex Input" as an input source (*System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > Others*). 

Now typing `Alt` + key won't interfere with any keyboard shortcuts. Happy RubyMining!
